# Flight Delay Analysis

**Platform Used**: Mode.com  
**Table Used**: tutorial.flights  
**Date of Work**: 27th May 2025

## Objective:
Analyze the flights dataset to extract insights related to delays, flight times, and operational metrics using SQL.

## Key SQL Concepts Used:
- Aggregates
- Common Table Expressions (CTE)
- CASE WHEN statements
- Joins
- GROUP BY and ORDER BY
- Alias names
- Logical operators

## Summary of Work:
- Identified flights with delay greater than 10 minutes
- Used CTEs for simplifying multi-step queries
- Calculated average delays per airline
- Filtered flights based on specific criteria like departure time or flight duration

## Notes:
This project helped reinforce use of complex SQL concepts for real-world datasets.
